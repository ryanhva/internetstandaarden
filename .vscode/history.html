            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Name</h3>
            <p>The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli (also used in English), an
                Italianization of the Libyan Arabic name for a hot desert wind (قبلي ghiblī) and nickname of the Italian
                Caproni Ca.309 aircraft.<br> The name was chosen by Miyazaki due to his passion for aviation and also
                for the idea that the studio would "blow a new wind through the anime industry".<br> Although the
                Italian word would be more accurately transliterated as "Giburi" (ギブリ), with a hard g sound, the
                studio's name is written in Japanese as Jiburi (ジブリ)</p>
            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>The studio's logo is Totoro, one of the best-known cartoon characters from the film My Neighbor Totoro
                that was released in 1988.<br> In Japan, Totoro also has the meaning Obake, which are shape-shifting
                creatures from Japanese folklore.<br> Due to the great popularity of both the studio and the character
                Totoro, various marketing products featuring Totoro's image can be found throughout Japan, such as
                cuddly toys, toys and mobile phone straps.</p>

            <!--Tokuma Shoten Era-->
            <h3>Tokuma Shoten Era</h3>
            <p>Founded on June 15, 1985, Studio Ghibli was headed by directors <a
                    href="directors_and_producer.html">Hayao Miyazaki</a> and <a href="directors_and_producer.html">Isao
                    Takahata</a> and producer <a href="directors_and_producer.html">Toshio Suzuki</a>. Miyazaki and
                Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together
                on The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun in 1968 and the Panda! Go, Panda! films in 1972 and
                1973. Suzuki had been an editor at Tokuma Shoten's Animage manga magazine.</p>
            <P>The studio was founded after the success of the 1984 film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Suzuki was
                part of the film's production team, and founded Studio Ghibli with Miyazaki, who also invited Takahata
                to join them.</P>
            <P>The studio has mainly produced films by Miyazaki, with the second most prolific director being Takahata
                (most notably with Grave of the Fireflies). Other directors who have worked with Studio Ghibli include
                Yoshifumi Kondō, Hiroyuki Morita, Gorō Miyazaki, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Composer Joe Hisaishi has
                provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films. In their book Anime Classics
                Zettai!, Brian Camp and Julie Davis made note of Michiyo Yasuda as "a mainstay of Studio Ghibli's
                extraordinary design and production team". At one time the studio was based in Kichijōji, Musashino,
                Tokyo.</P>
            <P>In August 1996, The Walt Disney Company and Tokuma Shoten formed a partnership wherein Walt Disney
                Studios would be the sole international distributor for Tokuma Shoten's Studio Ghibli animated films.
                Under this agreement, Disney also agreed to finance 10% of the studio's production costs. Since then,
                all three of the aforementioned films by Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli that were previously dubbed by
                Streamline Pictures have been re-dubbed by Disney. On June 1, 1997, Tokuma Shoten Publishing
                consolidated its media operations by merging Studio Ghibli, Tokuma Shoten Intermedia software and Tokuma
                International under one location.</P>
            <p>Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine Animage, which
                regularly runs exclusive articles on the studio and its members in a section titled "Ghibli Notes".
                Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works are frequently featured on the cover of the magazine. Saeko
                Himuro's novel Umi ga Kikoeru was serialised in the magazine and subsequently adapted into Ocean Waves,
                Studio Ghibli's first animated feature-length film created for television. It was directed by Tomomi
                Mochizuki.</p>
            <p>In October 2001, the Ghibli Museum opened in Mitaka, Tokyo. It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli
                films and shows animations, including a number of short Studio Ghibli films not available elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The studio is also known for its strict "no-edits" policy in licensing their films abroad due to Nausicaä
                of the Valley of the Wind being heavily edited for the film's release in the United States as Warriors
                of the Wind.</p>

            <!--independed era-->
            <h3>Independent Era</h3>
            <p>Between 1999 and 2005, Studio Ghibli was a subsidiary brand of Tokuma Shoten; however, that partnership
                ended in April 2005, when Studio Ghibli was spun off from Tokuma Shoten and was re-established as an
                independent company with relocated headquarters.</p>
            <p>On February 1, 2008, Toshio Suzuki stepped down from the position of Studio Ghibli president, which he
                had held since 2005, and Koji Hoshino (former president of Walt Disney Japan) took over. Suzuki said he
                wanted to improve films with his own hands as a producer, rather than demanding this from his employees.
                Suzuki decided to hand over the presidency to Hoshino because Hoshino has helped Studio Ghibli to sell
                its videos since 1996 and has also aided the release of the Princess Mononoke film in the United States.
                Suzuki still serves on the company's board of directors.</p>
            <p>Takahata developed a project for release after Gorō Miyazaki's (director of Tales from Earthsea and
                Hayao's son) The Tale of the Princess Kaguya – an adaptation of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. The last
                film Hayao Miyazaki directed before retiring from feature films was The Wind Rises which is about the
                Mitsubishi A6M Zero and its creator.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, September 1, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki held a press conference in Venice to confirm his retirement,
                saying: "I know I've said I would retire many times in the past. Many of you must think, 'Once again.'
                But this time I am quite serious."</p>
            <p>In 2013, a documentary directed by Mami Sunada called The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness (Japanese:
                夢と狂気の王国, Hepburn: Yume to kyōki no ōkoku) was created delving into the lives of those working at Studio
                Ghibli and the productions of the animated films The Wind Rises and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,
                including storyboard sketching, inking, painting, and voice actor selection for the films.</p>
            <p>On January 31, 2014, it was announced that Gorō Miyazaki will direct his first anime television series,
                Sanzoku no Musume Rōnya, an adaptation of Astrid Lindgren's Ronia the Robber's Daughter for NHK. The
                series is computer-animated, produced by Polygon Pictures, and co-produced by Studio Ghibli.</p>
            <p>In March 2014, Toshio Suzuki retired as producer and assumed the new position of general manager.
                Yoshiaki Nishimura replaced Suzuki in the producer role.</p>
            <p>On August 3, 2014, Toshio Suzuki announced that Studio Ghibli would take a "brief pause" to re-evaluate
                and restructure in the wake of Miyazaki's retirement. He stated some concerns about where the company
                would go in the future. This led to speculation that Studio Ghibli will never produce another feature
                film again. On November 7, 2014, Miyazaki stated, "That was not my intention, though. All I did was
                announce that I would be retiring and not making any more features." Lead producer Yoshiaki Nishimura
                among several other staffers from Ghibli, such as director Hiromasa Yonebayashi, left to found Studio
                Ponoc in April 2015, working on the film Mary and the Witch's Flower.</p>
            <p>The 2016 animated fantasy film The Red Turtle, directed and co-written by Dutch-British animator Michaël
                Dudok de Wit in his feature film debut, was a co-production between Studio Ghibli and Wild Bunch.</p>
            <p>In February 2017, Toshio Suzuki announced that Hayao Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new
                feature film with Studio Ghibli.</p>
            <p>On November 28, 2017, Koji Hoshino stepped down as president; he was replaced by Kiyofumi Nakajima
                (former Ghibli Museum director). Hoshino was then appointed as Chairman of Studio Ghibli.</p>
            <p>In May 2020, Toshio Suzuki confirmed that a new film from Gorō Miyazaki is in development at Studio
                Ghibli. On June 3, 2020, Studio Ghibli announced that the film would be an adaptation of the novel
                Earwig and the Witch by Diana Wynne Jones. The film was announced as the first full 3D CG animated
                Ghibli film and slated for a television premiere on NHK in late 2020.The company had a net income of
                ¥1.253 billion, and a total asset worth ¥24.521 billion by August 2021.</p>
            <p>On November 1, 2022, the Studio Ghibli themed amusement park Ghibli Park opened.</p>
            <p>On April 4, 2023, Koji Hoshino announced that he had stepped down as chairman, and would serve as a
                representative director before planning to exit Studio Ghibli completely during the company's annual
                general shareholder's meeting in June, one month prior to the release of director Hayao Miyazaki's final
                movie The Boy and the Heron on July 14. He also announced that Toshio Suzuki would be replacing Kiyofumi
                Nakajima as president of Studio Ghibli, assuming the role for the first time since 2008, while Nakajima
                would continue to serve as a director.This change of management came about amidst reports that Suzuki
                had allegedly been mismanaging company funds by directing them towards his girlfriend's failed business
                ventures. This reportedly created tension between Suzuki and Hoshino, with the latter reportedly citing
                it as a long-term internal problem at the company since the couple met in 2013 and was the reason for
                his planned departure from the company, although a spokesperson for Studio Ghibli in a statement to
                Variety denied that Hoshino's departure had anything to do with these reports.The source of the
                allegations came from the tabloid paper, Shūkan Josei and was not corroborated by the mainstream media
                in Japan.</p>
            <!--Nippon tv Era-->
            <h3>Nippon TV Era</h3>
            <p>In October 2023, the studio became a subsidiary of Nippon Television Holdings, Inc.. Studio Ghibli's
                leadership transitioned to Hiroyuki Fukuda, a senior executive at Nippon TV. Toshio Suzuki became
                Chairman and Hayao Miyazaki became Honorary Chairman. Nippon TV acquired a 42.3% stake in Studio Ghibli.
                The decision was driven by the advanced ages of Miyazaki and Suzuki, aged 82 and 75, respectively. The
                studio had considered Miyazaki's son, Goro Miyazaki, as a successor but opted for external leadership
                due to concerns and Goro's reluctance. Nippon TV started to handle management, allowing Studio Ghibli to
                focus on creative endeavors.The takeover took effect on October 6.</p>
