        <h2>What is studio ghibli?</h2>
            <p>Studio Ghibli, Inc. (Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ, Hepburn: Kabushiki gaisha Sutajio Jiburi) is a Japanese animation studio based in Koganei, Tokyo. It has a strong presence in the animation industry and has expanded its portfolio to include various media formats, such as short subjects, television commercials, and two television films. Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (tanuki) and cats from the 1988 film My Neighbor Totoro. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are Spirited Away (2001), Howl's Moving Castle (2004), and Ponyo (2008). Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets. The studio has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.</p>
            <p>Five of the studio's films are among the ten highest-grossing anime feature films made in Japan. Spirited Away is second, grossing 31.68 billion yen in Japan and over US$380 million worldwide; and Princess Mononoke is fourth, grossing 20.18 billion yen. Three of their films have won the Animage Grand Prix award, four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year, and five have received Academy Award nominations. Spirited Away won the 2002 Golden Bear and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.</p>
            <P>On August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production following Miyazaki's retirement. In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film, The Boy and the Heron (2023). In September 2023, Nippon TV announced that Studio Ghibli would become a unit of Nippon Television Holdings in October.</P>
